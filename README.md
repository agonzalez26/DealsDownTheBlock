Hello,

    DealsDownTheBlock was a cross-platform marking application that would help save people from going out of their way to save money when all they have to do is walk down the block. 
    Unfortunately, the app might nto be running since many of teh files were destroyed from the server. However, look at the link below and you can see what the application did.
    
   
    This link provides more information on the application.
